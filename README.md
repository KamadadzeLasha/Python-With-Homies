# Python with Homies

Welcome to the "Python with Homies" repository! This is a learning space designed to sketch out our(me and my homies :D) journey of learning Python language. üöÄ

## Schedule

We follow a structured schedule.

Week 1:  Basic operations, variables and IO(input/output) in Python

Week 2:  Flow control: branching and loops

Week 3:  Data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets

Week 4:  Functions, default arguments, scope and variable-length arguments

Week 5:  Functional Python: lambda functions. Iterators, generators, list and dictionary comprehensions.

Week 6:  Recursion, Decorators

Week 7:  File IO and error-handling

Week 8:  Collections and Streams

Week 9:  Object-Oriented Programming ‚Äì classes and objects

Week 10:  Object-Oriented Programming ‚Äì inheritance and special methods

Week 11:  Time and memory complexity, searching and sorting algorithms
(Will be updated)

Organizing our learning materials into weekly folders. Each week's folder contains a lecture file, seminar file, and homework file. 
As a reminder, the homework solutions of the previous week will be found in the corresponding `homeworkN.py` file, where `N` is the week number.

### File Structure

- **Week N:**
  - **Lecture:** `weekN/lectureN.py`
  - **Seminar:** `weekN/seminarN.py`
  - **Homework:** `weekN/homeworkN.py`
